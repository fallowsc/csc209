Tutorial six (ispalindrome.c)

Compiling ispalindrome.c:
Succeeded.

First, testing usage messages:
With zero arguments:
- exit status is 1 as expected
- that looks like it might be a usage message (good)
With two arguments:
- exit status is 1 as expected
- that looks like it might be a usage message (good)

Test with string with no alphanumeric characters:
Unexpected exit status 1 (should be 0)

Now, trying your program on 24 palindromes and non-palindromes:
Correct behaviour:
  12 out of 12 palindromes claimed to be palindromes
  12 out of 12 non-palindromes claimed not to be palindromes

Final score for tutorial 6: 0.9 out of 1
