tut4:

Grade for tut4 is 0.75 out of 1. 
Comments (mostly automated): 
        Compiles ok. 
        There are serious indentation problems which hinder reading your code. 
        Your program doesn't work for 0 and/or 1, but seems to give correct results for 2 through 30 inclusive. 
        Seems to exceed array bounds if argument is negative (this is a serious error, but no penalty this time). 
        Usage check seems correct (if argc != 2). 
        Usage message seems ok but is to stdout instead of stderr (no penalty this time, because we hadn't done fprintf yet). 
        You seem to have called atoi() twice (better to call it only once; no penalty).
